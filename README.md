# Code-That-Thesis

Welcome to **Code-That-Thesis**, a repository where I explore and implement interesting academic theses related to software engineering, algorithms, and programming. Each directory represents a specific thesis and contains both a summary of the paper as well as the implementation of its key concepts.

## Table of Contents

## Project Overview

This repository is aimed at providing code implementations for various theses in software programming and computer science. Each thesis directory includes:
- **A summary of the thesis**: A condensed version of the main ideas and methods proposed.
- **Code**: A practical implementation of the concepts and algorithms discussed in the thesis.
- **Data** (if applicable): Sample data used for testing the implementation.
- **Further Reading**: Links to the original thesis and any additional references.

The goal is to bring theoretical work to life through practical coding projects, making complex ideas more accessible and easier to understand.

## Thesis Implementations

Below is a list of the currently implemented theses. Each folder contains code, data (if applicable), and a readme file with details specific to that thesis.

1. **Algorithms and Methods for Video Transcoding**
    - **Description**: This thesis focuses on improving the efficiency of video transcoding algorithms using novel methods. It proposes three different video transcoding algorithms that reduce the computational complexity of the HEVC encoder by around 60% with negligible loss in rate-distortion performance.
    - **Directory Structure**:
        ```
        ├── Algorithms and Methods for Video Transcoding
        │   ├── codes    # Implementation of transcoding algorithms
        │   ├── data     # Sample video files for testing
        │   └── readme.md # Detailed explanation of the thesis and code
        ```

*More thesis implementations are on the way!*

## How to Contribute

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you find an interesting thesis and would like to implement it, feel free to:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Implement the thesis in a new folder, structured like the other thesis projects.
3. Submit a pull request with a summary of the thesis and your code.

Please ensure your code is well-documented, and the readme within your folder explains the core ideas of the thesis you're implementing.
